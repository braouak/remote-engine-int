Neither this Agreement nor any Order Form shall be dependent on Customer issuing a purchase order. Customer acknowledges that any purchase order is for its administrative convenience only and that Qlik has the right to issue an invoice and collect payment without a corresponding purchase order. Any additional or conflicting terms or conditions in any purchase order shall have no legal force or effect.

8.15. Limitation. Subject to applicable law, no action, regardless of form, arising out of this Agreement may be brought by Customer more than two (2) years after the cause of action arose.

8.16. Entire Agreement; Severability; Language. This Agreement, any attachments hereto or documents referenced in the Agreement are the complete statement of the mutual understanding of the Parties and supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements and communications pertaining to the subject matter of this Agreement. This Agreement may not be modified except in writing and signed by both Parties. If any provision of this Agreement is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be limited to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement will otherwise remain in force and effect. In the event of any conflicts or inconsistencies, the Agreement shall take precedence over the Order Form, but only with respect to the specific subject matter of each. For the avoidance of doubt, where an Order Form includes additional and more specific terms and conditions with respect to a concept addressed generally in this Agreement or does not address a concept addressed herein, no conflict shall be deemed to exist. The English language version of this Agreement shall be the governing version used when interpreting or construing this Agreement. 
 
8.17. Construction. For purposes of this Agreement: (i) the words "include," "includes" and "including" are deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation"; (ii) the word "or" is not exclusive; and (iii) words denoting the singular have a comparable meaning when used in the plural, and vice-versa. A Party's role in drafting this Agreement shall not be a basis for construing this Agreement in any manner against such Party. Any Qlik Order Form and the schedules and exhibits attached thereto are an integral part of this Agreement to the same extent as if they were set forth verbatim herein. 
 
8.18. Publicity. Customer hereby grants Qlik the right to list Customer as a customer of Qlik along with other customers in marketing materials such as the Qlik website, customer-facing presentations and press releases. 
 
8.19. Local Law Requirements. If Customer obtains Qlik Products from: (i) QlikTech GmbH and designates an address in Austria or Germany in an Order Form, or (ii) QlikTech Australia Pty Ltd and designates an address in Australia in an Order Form, then the terms of Addendum 1 shall be applicable and shall supersede any conflicting terms in the Agreement.

QLIK CUSTOMER AGREEMENT - ADDENDUM 1
(FOR CUSTOMERS IN GERMANY, AUSTRIA AND AUSTRALIA)

This Addendum to the Qlik User License Agreement ("Agreement") shall apply to Customers who purchase or subscribe to Qlik Products and have a contract address in Germany, Austria and Australia. In the event of any conflict, the terms of this Addendum 1 supersede any conflicting

terms in the Agreement.

1. 	Customers in Germany or Austria 
The terms in this Section 1 are applicable to any Customer who obtains its license key(s) from QlikTech GmbH, or is subject to the governing laws of Germany as set forth in Table 1 of this Agreement; and designates an address on an Order Form in Germany or Austria. 

1.1. Limited Warranty. With regard to perpetual Software licenses issued under this Agreement, the first three sentences of Section II, 9.1 of the Agreement shall not apply. Instead, the following limited warranty shall apply: Qlik warrants that the initial version of the Software delivered hereunder (but excluding any updates thereto provided as a result of Support) provides the functionalities set forth in the Documentation (the "agreed upon functionalities") for the limited warranty period following the Delivery Date when used on the recommended hardware configuration. As used in this Section, "limited warranty period" means one (1) year. Nonsubstantial variation from the agreed upon functionalities shall not be considered and does not establish any warranty rights. To make a warranty claim, Customer must notify Qlik in writing during the limited warranty period. If the functionalities of the Software 	vary 	substantially 	from 	the 	agreed 	upon functionalities, Qlik shall be entitled, by way of re-performance and at its own discretion, to repair or replace the Software. If this fails, Customer is entitled to cancel the purchase agreement (rescission). 
 
1.2. Limited Subscription Warranty. With regard to subscriptions issued under this Agreement, the following limited warranty shall apply: 
 
1.2.1 The Parties agree and acknowledge that the Qlik Products are provided "without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability, satisfactory quality, and fitness for a particular purpose, whereas Qlik shall remedy any defects in kind as part of its ongoing support obligations which are included and fully compensated by the support fee. Further, Qlik and its vendors disclaim any warranty that Customer's use of the Qlik Products will be uninterrupted or error free. Qlik does not warrant or guarantee that it will correct any errors or inaccuracies in GeoAnalytics or Geocoding data. Customer's use of the Qlik Products is solely at its own risk. 
 
1.2.2 The Parties agree and acknowledge that the following modifications of Customer's statutory warranty rights shall apply: 
Qlik shall have no liability for initial material defects of the Software (Sachmangel) regardless of whether they have been caused by Qlik's fault (verschuldensunabhangig); Customer's: (i) right of reduction (Minderung), (ii) setoff and (iii) retention shall be excluded unless, as regards to (ii) and (iii), Customer asserts such rights on the basis of claims that have been asserted by a final court judgment; 

Any warranty claims of Customer against Qlik shall become time-barred 12 months after the start of the statutory warranty period; and for the avoidance of doubt, the Parties agree and acknowledge no further warranty period shall apply in regard to updates or upgrades to the Software that Qlik provides during the initial or any renewal term of the subscription licenses. Any damage claim Customer has under an applicable warranty shall be limited by the limitation of liability provision set forth under Section 5 of this Agreement. 

Any damage claim Customer has under an applicable warranty shall be limited by the limitation of liability provision set forth under Section 5 of this Agreement. 
 
THE LIMITED WARRANTIES IN SECTIONS 1.1 AND 1.2 OF THIS ADDENDUM DO NOT APPLY TO SOFTWARE OR SERVICES PROVIDED TO CUSTOMER FREE OF CHARGE, OR SOFTWARE THAT HAS BEEN ALTERED BY CUSTOMER, OR TO UPDATES PROVIDED UNDER SUPPORT, TO THE EXTENT SUCH ALTERATIONS CAUSED A DEFECT. 
 
Third Party Intellectual Property Infringement Indemnification in Germany or Austria. 

Section 4 is supplemented by the following additional sentence: CUSTOMER'S STATUTORY CLAIMS FOR DAMAGES SHALL REMAIN UNAFFECTED, PROVIDED, HOWEVER; THAT ANY SUCH CLAIMS SHALL BE LIMITED BY THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AS SET FORTH HEREUNDER.  SECTION 1 OF THIS ADDENDUM AND SECTION 4 OF THE AGREEMENT 	STATE 	QLIK'S 	SOLE 	AND ENTIRE OBLIGATION AND LIABILITY, AND CUSTOMER'S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE RIGHT AND REMEDY, FOR INFRINGEMENT OR VIOLATION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. 
 
Limitation of Liability. Sections 5.1 to 5.3 of the Agreement are not applicable. Instead, subject to the provisions below, Qlik's statutory liability for damages shall be limited as follows: 
 
Qlik shall be liable only up to the amount of damages as typically foreseeable at the time of entering into the purchase agreement in respect of damages caused by a slightly negligent breach of a material contractual obligation (i.e. a contractual obligation the fulfilment of which is essential for the proper execution of this Agreement, the breach of which endangers the purpose of this Agreement and on the fulfilment of which Customer regularly relies). 
 
Qlik shall not be liable for damages caused by a slightly negligent breach of a non-material contractual obligation. The aforesaid limitation of liability shall not apply to any mandatory statutory liability, in particular to liability under the German Product Liability Act, liability for assuming a specific guarantee, liability for damages caused by willful misconduct or gross negligence, or any kind of willfully or negligently caused personal injuries, death or damages to health. 
 
Customer shall take all reasonable measures to avoid and reduce damages, in particular, to make back-up copies of data on a regular basis and to carry out security checks for the purpose of defending or detecting viruses and other disruptive programs within Customer's IT system. 
 
Regardless of the grounds giving rise to liability, Qlik shall not be liable for indirect and/or consequential damages, including loss of profits or interest, unless such damage has been caused by Qlik's willful misconduct or gross negligence. 
 
To the extent Qlik's liability is limited or excluded, the same shall apply in respect of any personal liability of Qlik's legal representatives, employees, suppliers, resellers and vicarious agents. 
 
Section 8.1 of the Agreement shall be amended as follows: For customers with perpetual licenses, only the right to receive Support will end upon termination of the Agreement. The Parties also agree to exclude the applicability of Section 580a German Civil Code for Qlik Products. Furthermore, the Parties agree that unless otherwise agreed between the Parties, subscriptions shall automatically renew for successive terms equal to the initial subscription period, however not for longer periods than 24 months. For clarity, Customers with multi-year subscriptions, which are auto renewed, may terminate such renewal only after 24 months, unless otherwise agreed by the Parties in writing. 
 
If a Customer subscribes to Qlik Cloud, Qlik's Service Level Agreement shall be amended to include the following sentence: IN ADDITION, STATUTORY DAMAGES SHALL REMAIN UNAFFECTED, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT ANY SUCH CLAIMS SHALL BE LIMITED BY THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AS SET FORTH IN THE AGREEMENT (LESS THE VALUE OF ANY SERVICE CREDITS PAID BY QLIK IN RESPECT OF THE RELEVANT QUARTER). 
 
Qlik Cloud Warranty. Section 12.1 of the Agreement shall be amended to include the following additional sentence: 
IN ADDITION, STATUTORY DAMAGES SHALL REMAIN UNAFFECTED, PROVIDED, HOWEVER; THAT ANY SUCH CLAIMS SHALL BE LIMITED BY THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AS SET FORTH IN THE AGREEMENT (LESS THE VALUE OF ANY SERVICE CREDITS PAID BY QLIK IN RESPECT OF THE RELEVANT QUARTER). 

2. 	Customers in Australia

If Customer is a "consumer" under the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth), then: (a) Customer's rights under Section 3 or 9 of the Agreement are separate and additional to any warranties or consumer guarantees that cannot be excluded under Australian law (including, without limitation, consumer guarantees as to title and acceptable quality under the Competition And Consumer Act) ("Non-Excludable Rights"); the limitations, exclusions and disclaimers contained in this Agreement shall not be apply to the extent that they purport to exclude any Non Excludable Rights; and (b) with respect to claims relating to breach of any Non Excludable Rights, the liability of Qlik is limited (where Qlik is authorized by law to do so) at Qlik's option to any one of resupplying, replacing or repairing, or paying the cost of resupplying, replacing or repairing the goods in respect of which the breach occurred, or resupplying or paying the cost of resupplying, the services in respect of which the breach occurred.
